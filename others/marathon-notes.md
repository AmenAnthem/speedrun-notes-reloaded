# Introduction
Amen is running the game and currently the only one doing so, and I'll try to give you some insights.
Some might remember this game, but likely only a few will do so in a fond way.
We are twin brothers who have quite a bit of nostalgia for it, because it was one of only a few games featuring a 2-player co-op story mode on the original Playstation.

# General

## Rules

### Game rules
- Runs are timed using RTA.
- The game must either be played on original hardware or on one of the following emulators: Mednafen
- Emulators must not be configured to run faster than 60 FPS. Save states and cheat engines are banned.
- The Playstation 2 fast disc speed option is not allowed.
- The used hardware or emulator and its version have to be stated in the run description.
- Runs must start with a hard reset, the bios screen must be shown in the footage. The whole game footage must be visible at all times.
- All in game cheats are banned expect for the unlock code for Fwank.

### Category rules
- Please read the general game rules before submitting a run.
- Finish the game as fast as possible in 1 Player mode.
- Timing starts on selecting a character and ends when the ending cutscene starts.
- Any character (including Fwank) may be used to complete a run.

## Options
There are a few options to set to save some time during the run:
- Increase lives: Running out of lives uses up a continue. Each use of a continue wastes about 2 additional seconds to using a life.
- Using a life wastes about 3 seconds.
- Lower difficulty: Lowers enemy damage => lowers use of lives => lowers use of continues.
- Rest is kept as-is.

## Character choice
- Sister Magpie is top-tier, see [character tier list](../guides/character-tier-list.md).
- Most important stats are weapon DPS and movement speed, both of which are top tier for her.

# Actual run
Intro cutscene and mission briefing are skipped.

## Desert
- To finish the level, one needs to collect at least 3 out of 8 key items and bring them to the end of it.
- So, there is a bit of optimization involved to gather any 3 key items using the quickest route.
- One needs to look out though for falling boulders, as they might one-shot.

## Oasis
- There would be a neat skip with which you could shave off about 15 seconds, but it's very inconsistent.
- The level - if done without that skip - requires one to build a bridge by shooting a totem which then falls over.
- For that, one needs to provoke the bad guy "Cheb" to fly into the totem by using a special.
- As a side note, this special is Sister Magpie's only bad attribute.

## Baracks
- This one requires on to shoot 5 radar dishes to open up the gate to a boss.
- Again, the route to reach those is optimized.
- The 2 lower ones are done using a trick where they are shot at from offscreen to minimize travel distance. For this, bullet travel speed is important, which saves up to 3 seconds here.
- A sound queue indicates if the dishes were destroyed.
- Walking right beside the walls makes the camera pan in such a way that visual lag is reduced.
- To ensure the possibility to face-tank the boss, one gets a health pick-up from a tent after destroying the second dish.
- The last dish can be done offscreen to reduce visual lag.
- For the boss, zooming the camera in reduces visual lag again, which saves about half a second.
- The rest is just face-tanking and shooting the boss' weak spot.

## Town
- Getting on the left elevator at the start is almost frame perfect.
- In general, the elevator cycles are dependent on the player's position and fully deterministic.
- Still, some elevators are quite hard to get on optimally. One false input might mess up cycle(s).
- The level's goal is to get 2 key items to open a door leading to the exit.
- Again, the route is optimized. For example, directly after getting the first key item, a warp takes one to the second one.
- The next elevator needs to be shot open. Using a special does not help there, but it gets rid of most of the approaching enemies.
- The container's health and hurtbox seem inconsistent.
- The rooftop bridges are quite finicky.

## Foundry
- Multiple death abuses are used to skip portions of the level.
- Namely, dying on burning ground (and dying in general) makes one invincible for about 4 seconds. During that time, burning ground can be skipped.
- There are again a few key items required for reaching a boss.
- The first death abuse saves about half a minute.
- Usually, one needs to use sprinklers to cool down the searing ground. In the next section, this is done, as it even saves time there.
- Moving on the conveyer belts is finicky. One needs to make sure not to hit the melting pots.
- Again, the melting pot cycles depend on player movement.
- The second death abuse saves about 40 seconds.
- Taking the power up before entering the boss' layer helps with the boss and following levels. This saves about half a minute over the course of the run.
- Being near the boss is a death sentence, so the trick is to move to a certain location at the entrance where the boss can be safely shot. If done correctly, this saves about 8 seconds.

## Monastery
- This one is quite annoying and leads to frequent resets.
- It requires one to lead the white-robed monks to shoot multiple crystal pillars.
- The crystal pieces then need to be rolled to the correct elevator slots to progress.
- The monks' behavior again depends on player movement, but any minor mistake might lead to monk positions which are hard to recover from fast.
- Inside the monastery, one again hugs the wall to reduce visual lag.
- The pit boss is very easy, hugging and shooting it from the side does the trick.

## Catacombs
- This is just a simple maze, the main challenge here is the boss which requires clean execution of strafe shooting.
- The power-up again is important for the boss(es) and the rest of the run.
- One needs to go onto the platforms to shoot the statues, but the push the player off. So one needs to strafe shoot and run against the current to safe time.

## Gallery
- Again, a few key cards need to be collected, otherwise the level is straight forward.
- The main challenge is avoiding damage to ensure that the power-ups are not lost. Otherwise, one would lose about half a minute.

## The boat
- There are 2 boxes here which need to be destroyed to reveal 2 tanks.
- These also need to be destroyed.
- Then, a submarine submerges in the center of the level which also needs to be destroyed.
- Correctly positioning the player character on the platform clips them onto the submarine. This marks the player character as OOB, so that the jetpack enemies cannot target them (they deal crazy damage).
- Any minor movement throws them off again though.
- Another OOB can be provoked then by standing close to the edge of the northern platform and getting knocked back by the submarine's bullets.

## Tropics
- Without the upcoming skip, the run would be about 5 minutes longer.
- It simply requires wiggling around on the slope to climb it, but this absolutely not intended.
- Otherwise, the level would require doing absolutely convoluted tasks.

## Chez Cheb
- Another straight forward maze.
- The only challenge again is avoiding damage. Not to preserve any power-ups, but simply to reduce death time.
- Also, the enemies here really like to block the player character.

## Cheb
- The final level. It requires one to gather multiple bombs and place them in 5 of Cheb's orifices.
- However, the bombs have a tendency to disappear out of the blue.
- Gathering the bombs is of course route-optimized, but a redundant one is usually included as a backup.
- By the way, we are in space now and shrunken, good stuff.
- The level is finished upon entering the space ship.

Time is as soon as the end cutscene starts playing.
