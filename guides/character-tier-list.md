# Introduction

This tier list reflects the results of some tests I did on all the playable characters, including the via cheat code unlockable character Fwank.
To have an easy time to get the overall score I used the austrian grading system, which has grades from 1 to 5, whereas 1 is the best and 5 is the worst. The overall score determines the characters overall viability for speedruns.

I included the following characteristics and added score mutlipliers based on their importance for speedrunning:
* Weapon DPS (x5)
* Running Speed (x4)
* Projectile Speed (x2)
* Accuracy (x2)
* Shooting Delay (x1)
* Special (x1)

As you can see I decided to give weapon DPS a higher mutliplier than running speed, as the difference in weapon dps between characters is huge whereas the difference in running speed isn't that huge and the overall time difference between these characteristics when it comes to overall time favours weapon DPS.

*Weapon DPS* is the most important characteristic as bosses need to be deposed fast and they mostly have huge health pools, so depending on the weapon DPS bosses can take a long time.

*Running speed* is extremely important of course, despite weapon DPS having the most influence on the run.

*Projectile speed* and *accuracy* are important for sections where you need to destroy something off screen, for instance the radars in the baracks. They are also helpful to kill enemies off screen to reduce lag. I included the projectile size in accuracy, as bigger projectiles hit way more easily.

*Shooting delay* isn't too important in the run, as weapon DPS is way more important, although it can help in sections where you need to be mobile and dispatch of enemies with multiple hits. According to my tests all characters except Bounca have about the same shooting delay, whereas Bounca has about double the shooting delay of the other characters.

Although the *special* doesn't really influence the run that much I decided to include it. All of the specials are solid as it is helpful in situations where you get swarmed. Unfortunately it doesn't deal much damage to bosses, so the ranking considers it solely with regards to crowd control.

# Conclusion

I can not stress enough how much better Sister Magpie is than the other characters. There really is no other option for one player.
For two player you should also use Sister Magpie and either Butch or Fwank as second character, although I think in this case it could be better to use Fwank over Butch simply because of the running speed, so you don't have different speeds. As Sister Magpie deals so much damage it shouldn't be that huge of a difference timewise.
